### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Gavin and welcome to my GitHub profile. Here is where I upload bits-and-bobs I work on in my spare time.

You'll find the source code to my personal website [here](https://github.com/GavinKenna/gavinkenna.io) which is in active development. I'm using it as a way to understand Frontend technologies more as I typically work more in the backend space.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [GavinKenna.io](https://www.gavinkenna.io).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Vue.js, Nuxt.js and Kotlin.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Java, Spring, Docker, Kubernetes and Raspberry Pi's! I love APIs and infrastructure-as-code
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Add me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gavinkenna/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: Instead of using "Foo" or "Bar" for variable names in tests, I use "Numberwang" and "Wangernumb" as a homage to the [greats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_Mitchell_and_Webb_Look)
